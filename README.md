# Investigation-of-the-nonMNIST-Dataset

The objective of this code in Jupyter Notebook is to learn about simple data curation practices related to the notMNIST dataset.

This dataset is designed to look like the classic MNIST dataset, while looking a little more like real data: it's a harder task, and the data is a lot less 'clean' than MNIST.

Though the implementations were not as accurate as the Neuralnets but still I was able to achieve accuracy of about 81%.
